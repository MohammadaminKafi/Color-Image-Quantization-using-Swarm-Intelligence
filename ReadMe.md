# Color Image Quantization using Swarm Intelligence

This project implements color image quantization using swarm intelligence techniques. It includes the implementation of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, based on the paper "Color Image Quantization: A Short Review and an Application with Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm," and a newly proposed and implemented method using Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO). Additionally, the project references a method based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) from the paper "A Color Image Quantization Algorithm Based on Particle Swarm."

## Algorithm Implementation Details

### Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm

The ABC algorithm mimics the foraging behavior of honey bees. The algorithm is divided into three phases: employed bee phase, onlooker bee phase, and scout bee phase. Each phase is responsible for exploring and exploiting the solution space to find optimal color centroids for quantizing the image.

#### Phases:
- **Employed Bee Phase:** Employed bees search for new food sources (solutions) around the current food source.
- **Onlooker Bee Phase:** Onlooker bees select food sources based on a probability related to the quality of the food source.
- **Scout Bee Phase:** Scouts search for new food sources randomly.

#### K-Means Integration:
Before each iteration, K-Means is applied to refine the centroids, ensuring that the local search is effective and that the centroids are better positioned.

### Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO)

The SMO algorithm is inspired by the foraging behavior of spider monkeys. It divides the population into groups and each group searches for food sources independently, allowing better exploration of the solution space.

#### Phases:
- **Updating Position Based on Local Leader:** Update each member's position using the local leader and a random neighbor. Accept the new position if it improves fitness.

- **Updating Position Based on Global Leader:** Update positions of selected members based on the global leader and a random neighbor. Accept improvements in fitness.

- **Learning Global Leader:** Identify the best solution as the global leader. Reset or increment the global leader counter (`GLC`) based on changes.

- **Learning Local Leader:** Identify the best solution in each group as the local leader. Reset or increment the local leader counter (`LLC`) based on changes.

- **Deciding Local Leader:** Reorganize the group if the local leader's counter exceeds a threshold. Update positions or generate new solutions, then re-evaluate the local leader.

- **Deciding Fission or Fusion:** Adjust the number of groups based on the global leader counter (`GLC`). Create new groups (fission) or merge all into one group (fusion), then reset `GLC`.


#### K-Means Integration:
Similar to ABC, K-Means is applied before each iteration in SMO to refine the centroids, ensuring that the solutions converge more effectively.

## Global Variables and Their Functionality
